```

---

## üõ† Example Requests

### Create a product
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '{"name":"iPhone 15","price":1200.50,"stock":15}'
```

### Get all products
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products
```

### Get products with filters
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products?min_price=1000&max_price=1500"
```

### Update a product
```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/1      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '{"price":999.99,"stock":20}'
```

### Delete a product

curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/1
```

## üß™ Testing
The project includes a **Feature Test** for product creation:

```bash
php artisan test
```

---

## üìñ Approach
- Used **Laravel 10** with `apiResource` for clean RESTful routes.  
- Created a dedicated `ProductRequest` class to handle validation rules.  
- Implemented price range filtering using query parameters (`min_price`, `max_price`).  
- Wrapped controller logic in `try/catch` blocks for clear error handling.  
- Wrote a **Feature Test** to validate product creation via the API.  
- Organized code in a clean and structured way (Models, Controllers, Requests, Tests).

---

## üìù Notes
- `.env` and `vendor/` folders are excluded from Git.  
- Commit history is split into meaningful steps (migration, controller, test, docs).  
- Designed for clarity, maintainability, and scalability.
